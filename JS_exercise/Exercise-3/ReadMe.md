Since the project works on LocalStorage, It won't contain any data. You will have to enter the data by yourself:
1.By using Signup form for individual person
2.Copying the following code.
localStorage.setItem("usernameharshvardhan","harshvardhan,harsh123,admin");
localStorage.setItem("usernamekrishna","krishna,ninja,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernameShivay", "Shivay,shivi,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernameSiddhi", "Siddhi,vampirediaries,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernameVedant", "Vedant,zeus,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernamezuber", "zuber,kabir,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernameTanvi", "Tanvi,simran1709,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernamevishal", "vishal,12345,student");
localStorage.setItem("usernameh", "h,asd,student");

paste this code in the console window of your current browser.
The value follows the format (Name,password,role);

The tasks 2 and 3 are also included in the webpage.
